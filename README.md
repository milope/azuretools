# Mike's Azure Tools
This repository will be used to add scripts and code to help the Azure and Azure Developer communities with common problems we run into when supporting Azure.

**NOTE**: Not all scripts are strictly for Azure troubleshooting. Some scripts can also be used for on-premise troubleshooting, such as the [Get-DirectorySizeSummary](https://github.com/milope/azuretools/blob/master/src/powershell/misc/Get-DirectorySizeSummary.ps1) script.
