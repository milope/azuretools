# [INCOMPLETE!!] Template: Azure Batch with no public IP using Azure NAT Gateway to enable outbound connectivity

The goal for this template is to create an Azure Batch with no IP and a no-IP Azure Batch pool that would use an Azure Virtual NAT to enable outbound Internet connectivity. As this template is currently unfinished, I'm still leaving it around for folks to reference its bits at this time. Hopefully, more to come.

## Remarks

Please note this template is not complete.
